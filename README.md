# Aspect Tool

## 🧭 Overview
A simple browser-based utility designed for **filmmakers, designers, and video editors** to intuitively calculate and visualize aspect ratios and resolutions.  
Just enter a ratio and press **Enter** — the tool automatically calculates the corresponding resolution.

If the ratio values entered are unusual or invalid, the preview rectangle turns **red** as a visual warning.  
The classic **CinemaScope (2.35:1)** ratio is recognized automatically and excluded from warnings.
